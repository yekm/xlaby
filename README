* Supported platforms

  This program was developped and tested under Linux and SunOS (not
sure about the Imakefile under SunOS, though). It should work under
any Unix platform with X11 (release 4 at least, I _think_). Please
let me know if you test it on anything else.


* Installation instructions

  To produce the makefile, run

      xmkmf

This should create a file called Makefile. To build the program, type

      make

Finally, to install it (the binary and the man page), run as root

      make install

By default, the binary goes in /usr/local/bin, the man page goes in
/usr/local/man/man6, and both belong to games:games. To change this,
edit the Imakefile to your convenience before running xmkmf.

  If you don't trust imakefiles (something I can't blame you for),
since xlaby is just one file, it's quite easy to compile by hand.
The following should do it:

      gcc -o xlaby xlaby.c -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11

(replace /usr/X11R6/include and /usr/X11R6/lib respectively by the
directories in which your X11/Xlib.h and libX11.so files can be
found; it may be that you don't even need these options).


* How to use it

  Try "xlaby --help" and "xlaby --info". You may also Read The Fine
Manual.


* Any questions?

  There is no FAQ yet as there are no AQs yet at all :-) If there
ever is one, it will be put on the authors' home page, so be sure
to check it before sending mail... That being said, bug reports and
comments are welcome.
